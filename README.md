This project consists of an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI from all the data fetched from the external OpenWeatherMap.com API and from the local API.
Instructions

    The server.js file and the website/app.js file are modified to fetch data from the OpenWeatherMap.com API and post User content to an local API via the route http://localhost:8000/api.

    The index.html is used for element references, and styling used via style.css.

    Resent date, temperature and user content are rendered via the dynamically updated UI on user click

    Original Project is provided via Udacity and done via Diaa Hassouna # Weather-Journal-App
